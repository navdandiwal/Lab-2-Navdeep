# Cat Info Viewer 

## Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to view and interact with data about various cat breeds. Users can:
- View all cat names
- Filter cats by health issues
- View weights in Imperial or Metric
- See intelligence and child-friendliness
- Calculate average intelligence for all or child-friendly cats

## Files in the Project

This is HTML file that contains:
- The complete structure of the user interface
- All buttons, inputs, and a `pre` tag for output
- Inline CSS for basic styling
- Inline JavaScript (within `<script>...</script>`) for all functionalities

## Sources Used

- **Cat Data:**
  The example cat breed data (e.g., Abyssinian, Birman, Bengal) is based on real-world breed data structures from:
  - [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)
  - Breed details like `health_issues`, `intelligence`, `child_friendly`, and `weight` ranges are simplified for demo purposes.
  - No API or external libraries were usedâ€”data is hard-coded into the JavaScript array.
